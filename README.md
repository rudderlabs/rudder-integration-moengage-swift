# Integrating RudderStack iOS SDK with MoEngage

This repository contains the resources and assets required to integrate the [RudderStack iOS SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-ios-sdk/) with [MoEngage](https://www.moengage.com/).

| For more information on configuring MoEngage as a destination in RudderStack and the supported events and their mappings, refer to the [MoEngage documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/marketing/moengage/).   |
| :--|


## Step 1: Integrate the SDK with MoEngage

1. Add [MoEngage](https://www.moengage.com/) as a destination in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).
2. `RudderMoEngage` is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install it, add the following line to your Podfile and followed by `pod install`, as shown:

```ruby
pod 'RudderMoEngage'
```

## Step 2: Initialize the RudderStack client (`RSClient`)

Place the following in your ```AppDelegate``` under the ```didFinishLaunchingWithOptions``` method:

### Objective C

```objective-c
RSConfig *config = [[RSConfig alloc] initWithWriteKey:WRITE_KEY];
[config dataPlaneURL:DATA_PLANE_URL];
[[RSClient sharedInstance] configureWith:config];
[[RSClient sharedInstance] addDestination:[[RudderMoEngageDestination alloc] init]];
```
### Swift

```swift
let config: RSConfig = RSConfig(writeKey: WRITE_KEY)
            .dataPlaneURL(DATA_PLANE_URL)
RSClient.sharedInstance().configure(with: config)
RSClient.sharedInstance().addDestination(RudderMoEngageDestination())
```

## Step 3: Send events

Follow the steps listed in the [RudderStack Swift SDK](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-ios/tree/master-v2#sending-events) repo to start sending events to MoEngage.
